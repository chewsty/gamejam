# AY Game Jam
A game by me, Nick, Fadi. At first we wanted to make something more complicated, using kaboom.js, but it is blocked by the school restrictions, so I couldn't look up any manuals. Then I tried to make a game with a custom engine along with a tutorial, but it was too complicated and I was not able to make it work. So in the end we ended up making it according to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2BmmYr9NQ) tutorial.
